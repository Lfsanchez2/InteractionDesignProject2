This project is focused on the social justice issue of immigration reform and the lives of undocumented people in the US. As an undocumented person myself, I have decided to put some of 
my own experiences into the game. I wanted to show how Ive had to become more cognizant of my status as I grow up and how I felt we've been demonized and targeted in the media. I also
want to use this as a chance to educate, as people who usually speak ill of undocumented people and their situations don't know about how difficult the process of citizenship actually is.
